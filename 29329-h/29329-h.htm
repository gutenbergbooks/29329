<h2><a name="Sandwiches">SANDWICHES</a></h2>


<p>Sandwiches may be made from one of
three or four kinds of bread; whole wheat
bread, Boston brown or oatmeal bread, white
bread and rye bread made into square, deep
loaves; in fact, all bread used for sandwiches
should be made especially for the purpose,
so that the slices may be in good form, and
sufficiently large to cut into fancy shapes.</p>

<p>The butter may be used plain, slightly
softened or it may be seasoned and flavored
with just a suspicion of paprika, a little white
pepper, and a few drops of Worcestershire
sauce.</p>

<p>For ordinary sandwiches use the bread
without toasting. For canapés, toast is to
be preferred. Sandwiches are principally
used for buffet lunches or evening sociables,
where only a light, substantial lunch is required.
In these days they are made in
great varieties. Almost all sorts of meat, if
properly seasoned, may be made into delicious
sandwiches. If the meat is slightly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8">8</a></span>moistened with cream or olive oil, sandwiches
for traveling, provided each one is
carefully wrapped in oiled paper, will keep
fresh three or four days. The small French
rolls may have the centres scooped out, the
spaces filled with chicken salad or chopped
oysters, and served as sandwiches. The
rolls may be made especially for that purpose,
not more than two inches long and one
and a half inches wide; with coffee, they
make an attractive meal easily served.</p>

<p>Ordinary sandwiches may be made either
square, triangular, long, narrow, round or
crescent shaped. One slice of bread will
usually make one round sandwich and one
crescent, provided the cutting is done economically.
Meat used for sandwiches should
be chopped very fine and slightly moistened
with cream, melted butter, olive oil or mayonnaise
dressing well seasoned. Fish should
be rubbed or pounded in a mortar; add
enough sauce tartare to make it sufficiently
moist to easily spread.</p>

<p>Turkey, chicken, game, tongue, beef and
mutton, with their proper seasonings, moistened
with either mayonnaise or French
dressing, make exceedingly nice sandwiches.</p>

<h3><a name="To_Keep_Sandwiches">To Keep Sandwiches</a></h3>

<p>It is frequently necessary to make sandwiches
several hours before they are needed.
As they dry quickly they must be carefully
wrapped or they will be unpalatable. Wring
from cold water two ordinary tea towels;
put one on top of the other. An old tablecloth
will answer the purpose very well. As
fast as the sandwiches are made put them
on top of the damp towel; when you have the
desired quantity, cover the top with moist
lettuce leaves; fold over the towels, and put
outside of this a perfectly dry, square cloth.
Sandwiches will keep in this way for several
hours, and in perfectly good condition. On
a very warm day they may be covered all
over with moist lettuce leaves; use the green
ones that are not so palatable or sightly for
garnishing.</p>


<h3 class="new-h3"><a name="Bread">Bread</a></h3>

<p>To make good sandwiches, especially
when one is a long way from a city, it is
quite necessary to know how to make sandwich
bread, which is quite different, or
should be, from ordinary bread. Compressed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10">10</a></span>yeast is always to be preferred, but if one
cannot get it, the next best is good home-made
yeast. Bread for sandwiches must be
baked in rather large square pans, and must
be just a little lighter and softer than bread
for the table. The following recipes will, I
am sure, help the &ldquo;out of town&rdquo; housewife.
Nut bread is usually made into simple bread
and butter sandwiches; the nuts in the bread
are quite sufficient filling.</p>


<h3 class="new-h3"><a name="Yeast">Yeast</a></h3>


<ul class="ingredients" style="width: 12em;">
<li>4 good sized potatoes</li>
<li>1 quart of boiling water</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of sugar</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of salt</li>
</ul>

<p>Pare and grate the potatoes into the hot
water, stir over the fire until it reaches boiling
point, and simmer gently for five minutes.
Take from the fire, add the sugar and
salt, and when lukewarm add a cupful of
yeast, or two dry yeast cakes that have been
moistened in a little water, or one cake of
compressed yeast. Turn the mixture into a
jar and cover with a saucer. Stir it down
as fast as it comes to the top of the jar.
When it falls, or ceases to be very light,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11">11</a></span>which will be five or six hours, pour it into a
bottle, put the cork in very loosely and stand
it in a cold place. Use one cupful of this to
each two loaves of bread.</p>


<h3 class="new-h3"><a name="German_Potato_Bread">German Potato Bread</a></h3>

<p>Boil one potato until tender; mash it
through a sieve, add to it a half pint of warm
water and a teaspoonful of sugar. Stir in
one cupful of flour and one cupful of yeast;
let this stand for two hours, or until very
light. It is better to make this at seven
o'clock, so the bread may be sponged at nine
or ten. Scald a pint of milk, add to it a pint
of water, beat in a quart and a pint of flour.
The batter should be thick enough to drop,
rather than pour from the spoon. Then stir
in the potato starter, and stand in a place
about 65° Fahr. over night. Next morning
knead thoroughly, adding flour. Put this
aside until very light, about two hours, then
mold into loaves, put it into square greased
pans, and when light bake in a moderately
quick oven three-quarters of an hour.</p>

<p>This recipe will make two box loaves and
a dozen rolls.</p>

<p>Trim the crusts from the entire loaf, butter
each slice and cut it off as thin as possible;
spread it quickly with the mixture, roll
and wrap it at once in waxed paper. If the
bread is home-made and cracks in the rolling,
put a colander over a kettle of boiling
water, throw in it a few slices at a time, as
soon as they have softened spread them with
soft butter, then cover with the mixture, roll
and wrap in waxed paper.</p>

<p>To make the mixture, chop sufficient cold

from one side, and a crescent above it. Almost
any sweet may be used. Serve with
chocolate or coffee according to the fruit,
either for an afternoon tea or an &ldquo;evening.&rdquo;</p>


<h3 class="new-h3"><a name="Cherry_Sandwiches">Cherry Sandwiches</a></h3>

<p>Chop a quarter of a pound of candied
cherries very fine, adding occasionally as you
chop them a few drops of orange juice, if
you use wine, a few drops of sherry. Mix
thoroughly and spread over water thins,
making it a little deeper in the center than at
the edges. These sandwiches are better
made from crackers than from bread. Arrange
neatly on a pretty glass dish, and they
are ready to serve.</p>

<h3><a name="Fig_Sandwiches">Fig Sandwiches</a></h3>

<p>Split a dozen figs and scrape out the soft
portion, rejecting the skins; work this to a
paste. Cut the slices of bread from the loaf,
buttering before you cut them; make them
quite thin. Remove the crusts, and spread
this thick paste over the bread and roll carefully;
press for a moment until there is no
danger of the roll opening; roll each in a
piece of tissue paper; twist the ends as you
would an old-fashioned &ldquo;secret,&rdquo; or they may
be tied with baby ribbon. These are exceedingly
wholesome and palatable.</p>


<h3 class="new-h3"><a name="Fruit_and_Nut_Sandwiches">Fruit and Nut Sandwiches</a></h3>

<p>These are perhaps the most attractive of
all the sweet sandwiches.</p>

<p>Put through the meat chopper a quarter
of a pound of almonds with half a pound of
washed figs, the same quantity of dates, the
same of raisins, and a pound of pecan nuts;
put them through alternately so that they
will be mixed in chopping. Pack the mixture
into round baking powder tins, pressing
it down firmly, and stand it aside over night.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59">59</a></span>When wanted, dip the tin in hot water,
loosen it with a knife and shake out the mixture.
With a sharp knife cut into very thin
slices and put them between two rounds of
buttered bread. Serve with chocolate.</p>

<p>The combination may be varied; candied
cherries, citron or any of the candied fruits
may be substituted for the dates and figs.
Brazilian and pine nuts may be substituted
for a portion of the pecans.</p>


<h3 class="new-h3"><a name="Orange_Marmalade_Sandwiches">Orange Marmalade Sandwiches</a></h3>

<p>These sandwiches may be made precisely
the same as fig sandwiches, substituting the
orange marmalade for the figs.</p>


<h3 class="new-h3"><a name="Sponge_Cake_Sandwiches">Sponge Cake Sandwiches</a></h3>

<p>Bake a sponge cake in a square loaf; cut
it into slices a quarter of an inch thick; cut
the slices into rounds with a small biscuit
cutter. With another small cutter take out
the center leaving the ring; put this ring on
top of a solid round making sort of a patty
as it were; fill the spaces with a mixture of
chopped candied fruit that has been soaked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60">60</a></span>in orange juice over night; cover the top
with the meringue made from white of egg
and sugar; put them in the oven to brown,
dish neatly and they are ready to use. These
cannot stand over an hour as the fruit will
soften the cake.</p>


<h3 class="new-h3"><a name="Fresh_Fruit_Sandwiches">Fresh Fruit Sandwiches</a></h3>

<p>These sandwiches are exceedingly nice to
serve for afternoon teas. They must be used
soon after they are made. They will, however,
if wrapped in a damp napkin, keep for
an hour, but as fruit is soft the bread is liable
to become moist, which spoils the sandwich.</p>

<p>Butter the bread and put between layers
of sliced strawberries, dusted with powdered
sugar; or raspberries, or large blackberries
cut into halves; or peaches, finely chopped;
or apple seasoned with a little salt, pepper,
olive oil and lemon juice; or sliced bananas
with a dash of lemon juice, are all nice.</p>


<h3 class="new-h3"><a name="Raisin_Sandwiches">Raisin Sandwiches</a></h3>

<p>Put one-half pound of seeded raisins
through the meat grinder, add a quarter of a
pound of almonds that have been blanched,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61">61</a></span>dried and ground. Add a half tumbler of
quince jelly, mix thoroughly and put between
thin slices of buttered white bread. These
sandwiches are very nice in place of cake for
afternoon teas or evening companies.</p>


<h3 class="new-h3"><a name="Afternoon_Teas">Afternoon Teas</a></h3>

<p>Stone a quarter of a pound of dates, put
them through a meat grinder, add to them a
half tumbler of nut butter, mix until smooth,
add four tablespoonfuls of sweet cream and
a tablespoonful of orange juice. Put this
mixture between thin slices of white buttered
bread, press together, trim the crusts and
cut into fingers or four small triangles.</p>


<h3 class="new-h3"><a name="Nut_and_Apple_Sandwiches">Nut and Apple Sandwiches</a></h3>

<p>Put a half cupful of <em>thick</em> stewed apples
into a bowl, add the grated yellow rind of
quarter of an orange and one cupful of finely
chopped mixed nuts. Spread this on saltines,
Uneedas, or any crisp cracker. Put on top
another cracker and serve at once. These
are very nice for children's parties. Of
course one may use buttered bread, either
white or brown.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62">62</a></span></div>
<h3><a name="Grape_Fruit_Sandwiches">Grape Fruit Sandwiches</a></h3>

<p>Spread any crisp cracker with a thin
layer of grape fruit marmalade, put on top
another cracker and serve at once.</p>


<h3 class="new-h3"><a name="Ginger_Sandwiches">Ginger Sandwiches</a></h3>

<p>Put four or five pieces of ginger through
your meat chopper. Stir this paste into a
half cupful of orange marmalade. Put between
slices of buttered bread, press them
together, trim the crusts and cut into fingers.
These are nice for afternoon teas. Ginger
and carrot marmalade are also very nice.</p>

<h2><a name="Canapes">CANAPÉS</a></h2>


<p>These are slices of bread cut into fancy
shapes, toasted or quickly fried in hot oil, or
they may be spread with butter and browned
in a quick oven. One slice only is used for
each canapé. The mixture is spread on top,
the top garnished, and the canapé used at
once.</p>


<h3 class="new-h3"><a name="Anchovy_Canapes">Anchovy Canapés</a></h3>

<p>Cover a round or square of toast with
anchovies that have been mashed and seasoned
with a little tomato catsup. Put a
little chopped celery around the edge as a
garnish and send at once to the table.</p>


<h3 class="new-h3"><a name="Caviar_Canapes">Caviar Canapés</a></h3>

<p>Season the caviar with onion and a very
little lemon juice; spread over a round or
square canapé, put chopped onion around the
edge, garnish the top with a hard-boiled egg;
place on paper mats and send at once to the
table. These are used as first course at lunch
or dinner.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>

<h3><a name="Swedish_Canapes">Swedish Canapes</a></h3>

<p>Cut thick slices of whole wheat or Graham
bread, trim the crusts and hollow out
the centers, being careful not to make a hole
all the way through. Pound or mash the
hard boiled yolks of three eggs with a tablespoonful
of anchovy paste or two anchovies,
two tablespoonfuls of butter and a dash of
lemon juice. Cut a dill pickle lengthwise
into slices an eighth of an inch thick, then
cut these slices into long strips a half inch
wide. Cut large pickled beets into strips of
the same width. Cut a dozen pimolas into
halves. Butter the bread, fill with the paste,
put over the strips of dill pickle, leaving one
inch between each strip. Cross these with
strips of pickled beets, put half of a pimola
into each square. Dish on paper mats.
Serve as an appetizer before soup.</p>


<h3 class="new-h3"><a name="Chopped_Tongue_Canapes">Chopped Tongue Canapés</a></h3>

<p>Chop cold, cooked tongue very fine; season
it with two tablespoonfuls of olive oil
and a dusting of pepper; spread it over the
top of a round of toasted bread; garnish the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65">65</a></span>edge with the small leaves of cress, put a
little grated hard-boiled egg in the center
and send at once to the table.</p>


<h3 class="new-h3"><a name="Sardine_Canapes">Sardine Canapés</a></h3>

<p>Remove the skin and pound the sardines
to a paste; put a thick layer of this paste
over the top of a round of toasted bread.
Cut one gherkin into very thin slices, arrange
them overlapping around the edge;
put a little finely chopped hard-boiled egg in
the center, and they are ready to serve.</p>


<h3 class="new-h3"><a name="Fish_Canapes">Fish Canapés</a></h3>

<p>Pound a quarter of a pound of cooked
fish to a paste; season it with a few drops of
onion juice, a saltspoonful of salt, and a dash
of black pepper. Stir into it two tablespoonfuls
of sauce tartare; spread this on six or
eight rounds of buttered bread browned in
the oven; garnish the tops with grated cucumber
and send to the table.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66">66</a></span></div>
<h3><a name="Deviled_Oyster_Canapes">Deviled Oyster Canapés</a></h3>

<p>Cut slices of bread into squares, toast
and remove the crusts. Remove the hard
part from a pint of pickled oysters, place
oysters over bread, close together and in
rotation, dust thickly with red pepper; put
over as a thin covering a highly seasoned
sauce mayonnaise, and serve. Do not put
over a second piece of bread.</p>


<h3 class="new-h3"><a name="Pate_de_Foie_Gras_Canapes">Pâté de Foie Gras Canapés</a></h3>

<p>For twenty-four sandwiches take one
tureen of foie gras. Remove the fat, and
mash the foie gras to a perfectly smooth
paste, adding gradually four tablespoonfuls
of soft, not melted, butter; add a dash of
cayenne and a half teaspoonful of salt and
about ten drops of onion juice, and press the
whole through a sieve. Cut slices of bread
into fancy shapes and toast; crescents are
very pretty. Cover each slice thickly with
this paste; garnish with hard-boiled white of
egg, cut into diamonds or tiny crescents, and
olives cut into rings. Arrange neatly, and
they are ready to serve.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67">67</a></span></div>
<h3><a name="Hot_Canapes">Hot Canapés</a></h3>

<p>A canapé is the half of a sandwich, as it
were. Minced meats of various kinds are
served on one slice of bread. In many books
they are called &ldquo;uncovered sandwiches.&rdquo; The
cold canapés are placed always among the
appetizers and served before the soup. They
are made of such materials as caviar, sardines,
anchovies, pickled oysters, pickled lobster,
deviled shrimps, or a mixture of one or
two of these materials.</p>

<p>A hot canapé, however, is served in the
place of fish or as an entrée. If they are
dressed with either fish or shell-fish they will
take the place of that course. When made
from chicken, sweetbreads or game, should
be served as an entrée, following the fish.</p>


<h3 class="new-h3"><a name="Fish_Canapes_2">Fish Canapés</a></h3>

<p>Pick apart sufficient cold cooked fish to
make a half pint. Rub together two level
tablespoonfuls of butter and two of flour, add
a half pint of milk, stir until boiling, add a
half teaspoonful of salt, a teaspoonful of soy,
a dash of red pepper and a half saltspoonful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68">68</a></span>of black pepper. When this is hot add the
fish and four or five nice sliced mushrooms;
stand over hot water, without stirring, until
the fish is thoroughly heated. While this is
heating, trim the crusts from six slices of
bread; toast the one side carefully. Have
ready in your pastry bag with a star tube a
pint of light mashed potatoes; press in a
rope-like form, or in small rosettes, around
the edge of the bread on the untoasted side.
Brush the bread with a little melted butter,
put them in the oven until the potatoes and
bread are a golden brown. Dish these on
square paper mats on individual plates, fill
the centers with the creamed fish and send at
once to the table.</p>

<p>Canned salmon may be used in the place
of fresh boiled fish.</p>

<h3><a name="Lobster_Canapes">Lobster Canapés</a></h3>


<ul class="ingredients" style="width: 16.5em;">
<li>1 three-pound lobster</li>
<li>The yolks of two eggs</li>
<li>2 level tablespoonfuls of butter</li>
<li>2 level tablespoonfuls of flour</li>
<li>½ pint of milk</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of chopped parsley</li>
<li>1 level teaspoonful of salt</li>
<li>1 saltspoonful of white pepper</li>
<li>1 pint of mashed potatoes</li>
<li>6 slices of bread</li>
</ul>

<p>Toast the bread and arrange the potatoes
according to the preceding recipe. Rub the
butter and flour together, add the milk; when
boiling add the seasoning and the lobster.
When very hot stir in carefully the well-beaten
yolks of the eggs. Stir this until it
is smoking hot, but be careful not to boil, or
it will curdle. Fill this on top of the toast
that has been garnished with potatoes, dust
with chopped parsley and send to the table.</p>

<p>Shrimps may be substituted for lobster.</p>

<h3><a name="Sweetbread_Canapes">Sweetbread Canapés</a></h3>


<ul class="ingredients" style="width: 15em;">
<li>1 pair calf's sweetbreads</li>
<li>½ can of mushrooms</li>
<li>2 level tablespoonfuls of butter</li>
<li>2 level tablespoonfuls of flour</li>
<li>½ pint of milk</li>
<li>½ teaspoonful of salt</li>
<li>1 saltspoonful of pepper</li>
</ul>

<p>Boil the sweetbreads carefully for three-quarters
of an hour; throw them into cold
water; pick them apart, rejecting the membrane.
Chop the mushrooms very fine, add
them to the sweetbreads. Rub the butter
and flour together, add the milk; when boiling
add the salt, pepper, sweetbreads and
mushrooms; cover and stand over hot water
ten to fifteen minutes. Serve them on slices
of bread, garnished with mashed potatoes
pressed through a star tube.</p>

<h3><a name="Canapes_a_la_Trinidad">Canapés à la Trinidad</a></h3>


<ul class="ingredients" style="width: 20.5em;">
<li>Half the white meat from one boiled chicken</li>
<li>1 pair of sweetbreads</li>
<li>6 large fresh mushrooms</li>
<li>2 level tablespoonfuls of butter</li>
<li>2 level tablespoonfuls of flour</li>
<li>½ pint of milk</li>
<li>2 yolks of hard-boiled eggs</li>
<li>1 level teaspoonful of salt</li>
<li>1 saltspoonful of pepper</li>
</ul>

<p>Cut twelve slices of bread; trim the crusts
so the slices will be of even size. Cut out
the centers from one-half the slices, leaving
a wall of one inch. Toast the solid slices.
Brush the untoasted edge of the bread with
a little white of egg, lay on the rims and put
them in the oven to toast on the upper side.
Pick the sweetbreads apart, after they are
carefully cooked, rejecting the membrane.
Slice the mushrooms. Cut the chicken into
dice. Put the butter into a saucepan, add the
mushrooms, toss for a minute until the mushrooms
are slightly softened, then add the
flour, mix, and add the milk, salt and pepper.
Cover this on the back part of the stove for
ten or fifteen minutes until the mushrooms
are cooked; then add the meat. Stand this
over hot water ten or fifteen minutes. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72">72</a></span>toast should now be done and crisp. Arrange
each canapé on a square of lace paper
on an individual heated dish, put the mixture
in the center, garnish with the yolk of the
eggs pressed through a sieve. Garnish the
very top with a little chopped truffle or a
little chopped parsley. These are the handsomest
of all hot canapés, and while they are
usually served following the soup at dinner,
they may be used for the main course at a
ladies' luncheon, or at a supper.</p>


<h3 class="new-h3"><a name="Game_Canapes">Game Canapés</a></h3>

<p>Cut any pieces of left-over game into dice.
Put two tablespoonfuls of butter and two of
flour in a saucepan, add a half pint of stock.
When boiling add a half can of very fine
mushrooms, a tablespoonful of chopped ham,
a tablespoonful of chopped parsley, a level
teaspoonful of salt and a saltspoonful of pepper.
Bring this to a boil, add the game;
stand over hot water for fifteen or twenty
minutes until the game has absorbed part of
the sauce, then add two tablespoonfuls of
sherry or Madeira, and fill into the square
canapés made the same as in preceding recipe.</p>

<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73">73</a></span></div>
<h3><a name="Lamb_Canapes">Lamb Canapés</a></h3>


<ul class="ingredients" style="width: 17em;">
<li>2 cans, or one quart of cooked peas</li>
<li>1 blade of mace</li>
<li>2 level tablespoonfuls of butter</li>
<li>2 level tablespoonfuls of flour</li>
<li>½ pint of stock</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful of kitchen bouquet</li>
<li>½ teaspoonful of salt</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of chopped onion</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of claret</li>
<li>1 saltspoonful of pepper</li>
</ul>

<p>Put the butter and onion in a saucepan,
shake it over the fire, then add the cold boiled
lamb, cut into blocks; you should have one
pint. When this is boiling add all the seasoning
and stand the mixture over hot water
on the back of the stove while you make the
canapés. Press the peas through a sieve;
the pulp must be quite dry; add to it a palatable
seasoning of salt and pepper and one or
two tablespoonfuls of melted butter. Put
these in a pastry bag. Toast the bread on
one side, put the peas around in rope-like
form, or roses, on the untoasted side, making
a border sufficiently high to hold the lamb.
Stand in the oven until the bread is carefully
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74">74</a></span>toasted. Arrange them on lace papers on
heated plates, fill the center with the lamb
mixture and send to the table.</p>


<h3 class="new-h3"><a name="Club-House_Sandwiches">Club-House Sandwiches</a></h3>

<p>Club-house sandwiches may be made in
a number of different ways, but are served
warm as a rule on bread carefully toasted at
the last moment. Put on top of a square of
toasted bread a thin layer of broiled ham or
bacon; on top of this a thin slice of Holland
pickle, on top of that a thin slice of cold
roasted chicken or turkey, then a leaf of lettuce
in the center of which you put a teaspoonful
of mayonnaise dressing; cover this
with another slice of buttered toast. Press
the two together, and cut from one corner to
another making two large triangles, and
send at once to the table.</p>

<p>People not using ham may make a palatable
sandwich by putting down first a layer
of cold boiled tongue, then a layer of Holland
cucumber, a layer of turkey or chicken,
another layer of cucumber and the slice of
toast. Garnish with little pieces of water
cress before putting on the last slice.</p>

<h2><a name="Scented_Sandwiches">SCENTED SANDWICHES</a></h2>


<p>There is a group of rather æsthetic sandwiches
made from thin slices of bread and
butter flavored or scented with flowers.
Among those in common use are clover, rose
and the nasturtium.</p>

<p>The crust is trimmed off from the outside
of the loaf; the loaf placed down in a
clean stone jar in a nest of clover blossoms;
the butter is put in a piece of cheese cloth
and also covered with clover, and the jar
covered over night. The next morning the
bread and butter will have the flavor of
clover.</p>


<h3 class="new-h3"><a name="Rose_Sandwiches">Rose Sandwiches</a></h3>

<p>In making rose sandwiches cover the
bread and butter with rose leaves over night.
Put a few rose petals between the slices when
making the sandwiches.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76">76</a></span></div>
<h3><a name="Nasturtium_Sandwiches">Nasturtium Sandwiches</a></h3>

<p>Cover the bread and butter with nasturtium
flowers over night. In making the
sandwiches place at each corner of the slice
a flower, so that in cutting from corner to
corner you have a little triangular sandwich
holding a nasturtium flower uncut.</p>


<h3 class="new-h3"><a name="Violet_Sandwiches">Violet Sandwiches</a></h3>

<p>These are made the same, covering the
slice of bread and butter with the petals of
the violet.</p>

<h1>SOME OTHER BOOKS<br/>
<small>Published by</small><br/>
<big>Arnold and Company</big></h1>


<h2>Mrs. Rorer's<br/>
NEW Cook Book</h2>

<p>A big book of 731 pages, abundantly illustrated. Its
bigness is no criterion of its goodness. The fact that
it is the best work of the best years of Mrs. Rorer's
life; that it is a complete new book telling of the things
one needs to know about cooking, living, health, and
the easiest and best way of housekeeping&mdash;these are
what make for goodness, and place this book far in
advance of any other of a like nature.</p>

<p>The New Cook Book covers all departments of
cookery. A masterly exposition of each subject is
given, followed by recipes for the proper preparation,
cooking and serving of the various kinds of foods.
There are over 1500 recipes in the book.</p>

<p>The illustrations are an important feature. One
set of pictures shows the proper dressing of the table
during a course dinner. Then there is a complete set
showing the method of carving meats, poultry, game,
etc.; and many others illustrating special features of
the book.</p>

<p class="details">Large 12mo, 731 pages, profusely and beautifully
illustrated; bound in cloth, $2.00 net;
by mail, $2.20</p>


<h2>Mrs. Rorer's<br/>
Philadelphia Cook Book</h2>

<p>This is the standard book of Mrs. Rorer's that has
been before the public for a number of years. It has
no connection with Mrs. Rorer's New Cook Book.
Each book is independent of the other, and the possession
of one forms no reason for doing without the
other.</p>

<p>The Philadelphia Cook Book is full of good things,
and, like all of Mrs. Rorer's works, is eminently practical.
It is a standard of excellence, in that it is
full of the brightest things in cookery; the recipes
are absolutely reliable, and the general instructions
to housekeepers of the most helpful and necessary
character.</p>

<p>Nearly all cook books assume some knowledge and
experience on the part of those who use them, but Mrs.
Rorer makes her explanations so clear, and gives such
definite directions, as to quantities, that the beginner
has no difficulty in successfully accomplishing all the
book calls for. Then there are frequent hints as to
the proper use of left-overs, how to market, and, in
many ways, information is given that is alike useful to
the experienced cook as to the tyro in matters culinary.</p>

<p>The book is full of choice recipes, every one of
which has been successfully tested by Mrs. Rorer and
found to come out right. This alone is of incalculable
benefit and ought to commend the book to the favorable
consideration of every housekeeper.</p>

<p>The use of this book in the home means better
health, better living, economy in the use of food, and
a consequent saving in dollars and cents.</p>

<p class="details">12mo, nearly 600 pages, with portrait of author;
bound in cloth, $1.00 net; by mail, $1.15</p>


<h2>Mrs. Rorer's<br/>
Vegetable Cookery and Meat
Substitutes</h2>

<p><b>This book has a twofold object:</b></p>

<ol>
<li>To show the value of vegetables in their relation to
diet and health, how to prepare, cook and serve
them, what to eat under certain conditions of health,
and thus have them perform their proper work.</li>

<li>To give to the prudent housewife a knowledge of
combinations of foods in the shape of toothsome
recipes to take the place of meat, or as we call
them&mdash;Meat Substitutes.</li>
</ol>

<p>It goes without saying that we all know too little
about the value of vegetables as food. We eat them
because they are palatable, not realizing their immense
importance as body builders. Here they are classified,
and thus made to give us a right idea of their use.</p>

<p>Then as to Meat Substitutes. It is not necessary
to be a vegetarian to desire a change from a meat diet.
There are health reasons often demanding abstention
from meats; or economy may be an impelling motive;
or a desire for change and variety in the daily bill of
fare may be warrant enough. However we look at it
here is the wonder book to point the way to better and
healthier living.</p>

<p>There is an abundance of the choicest and most
palatable recipes, and they are given in such a manner,
that if the directions are followed, the results are sure.
You cannot make mistakes.</p>

did not have some that appealed to her more strongly
than others. She has gathered these together, classifying
them under their different heads. There are Best

<h2>Mrs. Rorer's<br/> New Salads</h2>

<p>For Dinners, Luncheons, Suppers and Receptions.
With a group of <span class="smcap">Odd Salads</span> and some <span class="smcap">Ceylon Salads</span>.</p>

<p>A salad made from a succulent green vegetable and
French dressing, should be seen on the dinner table
in every well-regulated household three hundred and
sixty-five times a year. These green vegetables contain
the salts necessary to the well being of our blood; the
oil is an easily-digested form of fatty matter; the lemon
juice gives us sufficient acid; therefore simple salads
are exceedingly wholesome.</p>

<p>During the summer, the dinner salad may be composed
of any well-cooked green vegetable, served with
a French dressing; string beans, cauliflower, a mixture
of peas, turnips, carrots and new beets, boiled radishes,
cucumbers, tomatoes, uncooked cabbage, and cooked
spinach. In the winter serve celery, lettuce, endive and
chicory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Economical marketing does not mean the purchase
of inferior articles at a cheap price, but of a small
quantity of the best materials found in the market;
these materials to be wisely and economically used.
Small quantity and no waste, just enough and not a
piece too much, is a good rule to remember. In roasts
and steaks, however, there will be, in spite of careful
buying, bits left over, that if economically used, may
be converted into palatable, sightly and wholesome
dishes for the next day's lunch or <ins title="supper.">supper.&rdquo;</ins></p>
